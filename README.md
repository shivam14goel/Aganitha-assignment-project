## 🤖 LLM Assistance

This project was developed with the assistance of a Large Language Model (ChatGPT).  
The LLM was used to:
- Debug configuration issues with TailwindCSS (v4) and PostCSS.  
- Guide setup and deployment on CodeSandbox.  

By leveraging an LLM, the development process was faster and more reliable, ensuring best practices were followed.


## ✅ Future Improvements

If given more time, the app can be extended with:

📖 Recipe details page (ingredients, cooking instructions, YouTube link).

⭐ Save favorites (store in local storage).

🎲 Random recipe generator.

🌍 Filter by cuisine or category.
